          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            By virtue of the Pro-Bono Project module, I am grateful to have the
            opportunity to contribute to a project concerning tackling Online
            Gender Based Violence (OGBV) in Malaysia. My group and I were tasked
            to collaborate with the School of Computer Science, whereby we
            provided them legal advice to help them develop their censoring
            extension. This project has profoundly impacted our perspective of
            OGBV, opening our eyes to the many real stories of OGBV happening in
            Malaysia and I appreciate the opportunity to delve deeper in the
            available legal recourses to aid victims who face OGBV.

        <section id="beginning">
          <h2>The Beginning - Research</h2>
          <p>
            The specific goals of our project were two-fold: to conduct in-depth
            research regarding the initiatives in handling OGBV and to advise
            the School of Computer Science regarding the topic of OGBV in
            Malaysia. Our objective was to ensure that their web extension was
            not only technically sound but legally compliant in addressing OGBV.
            We were provided a report template by our lecturer, in which six
            questions were posed for us to conduct research on and in light of
            this, my group leader delegated the tasks. As a group, we
            communicated to each other through WhatsApp to discuss further
            regarding our project. We reminded each other of our deadlines and
            helped each other whenever clarification was needed. Additionally,
            we had a shared Google drive where each of our research was
            available for us to look through and to ensure there were no
            overlaps.
          </p>
          <p>
            I worked together with another one of my teammates, where we had to
            research on the available initiatives in Malaysia to mitigate OGBV.
            Our research process involved analyzing statutes, searching for
            reported cases and reading through news articles concerning OGBV. It
            was interesting to discover that there are many initiatives in
            Malaysia in helping victims of OGBV, such as the newly introduced
            anti-stalking law and the Anti-Sexual Harassment Act 2022. Further,
            I also discovered that NGOs have played a crucial role in supporting
            victims. Although there are still minor setbacks in protecting
            victims, I was relieved to know that Malaysia has made so much
            progress in ensuring women can have a safer space on the Internet.

          <h2>Collaborating with School of Computer Science</h2>
          <p>
            The collaboration with the Computer Science students was a central
            aspect of our project, in which we provided legal guidance regarding
            OGBV in order for them to develop an effective web extension. Before
            we had our first meeting, I expected that they would develop an app
            to tackle OGBV and I was skeptical on its effectiveness. However,
            they presented us their idea on developing a web extension which
            censors any sexist or hateful words. It also acts as a reporting
            system where users can report other problematic users, and warnings
            regarding this problematic user would be issued to future users. I
            found the idea fascinating as I believe it would be an effective way
            in providing a safer space for women on the Internet. Further, it
            would notify a woman to be more careful on who they interacted with.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our group and the School of Computer Science had our first meeting
            physically so that we could introduce ourselves. Although a little
            awkward at first, the discussion flowed naturally and our group was
            relieved that they were very prepared with their extension planning.
            The next meetings were then conducted online as it was hard to find
            a time where every member would be on campus. However, I am grateful
            that we had no issues with communication and the Computer Science
            students were always consistent in addressing our questions. In Week
            12, they presented us with their web extension and I was impressed
            at how much they have gotten done in only a few weeks. Though
            currently there are still some limitations as it is still a
            prototype, I definitely believe it has tremendous potential in
            helping women on the Internet.

          <h2>Importance of Teamwork</h2>
          <p>
            Group assignments are not foreign to me as there have always been at
            least 2 group assignments every semester. However, this group
            assignment posed some challenges as I had to work with law students
            from other semesters. I felt anxious that I had to work with
            students that I wasn't familiar with but thankfully, we constantly
            made sure we were on track as discussed and we made sure that all of
            our parts were consistent with each other’s.
          </p>
          <p>
            Naturally, there were some communication issues such as group
            members not updating on their work, we managed to work through this
            issue. We made sure that the group members were constantly updated
            by advising them to always check the group chat and reminding them
            of any deadlines. Conflicts are normal when it comes to group
            assignments, but we learned the importance of listening to one
            another compromising. As a team, we made sure that everyone’s voices
            could be heard. All in all, it was a good experience to work with
            students from other semesters and having the opportunity to bounce
            ideas off of one another.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            This project highlighted the importance of teamwork in addressing
            complex issues. Legal remedies alone are often insufficient, it has
            to be complimented by technological advancements and practical
            measures. This was a valuable learning experience, in which it made
            me realize how my legal education can contribute a difference to the
            community. It has also made me more educated and aware on the
            seriousness of OGBV in Malaysia and I appreciate the opportunity to
            contribute to the School of Computer’s Science web extension, which
            I have no doubt would be effective in addressing OGBV.
